{1:overview Overview}

PaComb is a parsing libraries that compiles grammars with
semantic actions to combinators that can be used for parsing.  Languages
are defined with the {!Pacomb.Grammar} module or preferably through our PPX
extension. The library offers {e scanner less} parsing, but the {!Pacomb.Lex}
module provides a notion of {e terminals} and the {!Pacomb.Blank} module allows
to define function ignoring spaces and comments. This and other modules like
{!Pacomb.Keywords} and {!Pacomb.Word_list} makes the scanner less approach
very easy to use.

Pacomb is available via {{:https://opam.ocaml.org} opam} and from {{:https://github.com/craff/pacomb} github}

The main advantage of PaComb is to offer many features in one tool:
+ BNF/EBNF like syntax to define grammars directly in your ML file using our ppx extension
+ Parsing from left to right despite the use of combinators (hence
  the beginning of the input buffer can be collected by the GC).
+ Support for ambiguous grammars with polynomial complexity using {e cache} and {e merge}
 (see {!ambiguous})
+ Support for self extensible grammars via {e {!dependent}}
+ Rejection of rule from action code using {!Pacomb.Lex.give_up}
+ Support for utf8 characters and graphemes (grapheme is the correct notion as it is
  atomic for unicode normalisation)
+ Lexical convention (blank, comments, etc...) can change during parsing using
  {!Pacomb.Grammar.layout} and the fact that we use scanner less parsing.
+ Possibility to print the grammar (not perfect yet). This is useful to implement
  helps in your program using {!Pacomb.Grammar.print_grammar}.

Importantly, {e performances} of PaComb are very good: it is often less than two
times slower than grammars generated by ocamlyacc. However, using specific
Pacomb features like dependant sequences or cache will result in much slower
grammar ... that you can not in general write with ocamlyacc anyway.

{1:ppx PPX syntax extension}

Defining languages using the {!Pacomb.Grammar} module directly is cumbersome.
For that reason, PaComb provides a BNF-like PPX syntax extension. An example
with arithmetic expressions is given below. It can be compiled with command
[ocamlfind ocamlopt -package pacomb,pacomb.ppx -o calc -linkpkg calc.ml] (if
it is written to a file [calc.ml]). This example an many others are available
in the [examples] folder of the source distribution of opam.
{[
   type p = Atom | Prod | Sum
   let%parser rec expr p =
     Atom < Prod < Sum
     ; (p=Atom) (x::FLOAT)                        => x
     ; (p=Atom) '(' (e::expr Sum) ')'             => e
     ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) '*' (y::expr Atom) => x *. y
     ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) '/' (y::expr Atom) => x /. y
     ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) '+' (y::expr Prod) => x +. y
     ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) '-' (y::expr Prod) => x -. y
]}

Let us explain a bit this example, it is a BNF using priorities from type [p].
The first rule [Atom < Prod < Sum] says that expressions at [Atom] level are
included in expression at [Prod] level which are themselves included in expression
at [Sum] level.

Action are given after the infix symbol [ => ].
Rules are separated by semicolon and here, they all start with a guard indicated
at which priority level the rule applies. The terminals in the grammar are [(x::FLOAT)],
which is a predefined grammar for floating point numbers, binding the variable [x] for use in action code.
and ['('], [')'], ['*'], ... which parse a single character (string are allowed too).
The non terminals are [(x::expr Prod)], [(y::expr Atom)], ... which recursively call
the same grammar at the given priority level. Parentheses are mandatory as we use OCaml
priority for [_ :: _].

To use the above parser, you need to define a toplevel rule,
say which characters to ignore and call the parser on a file or string. For
instance the following will work and handle parse error without exiting the program:
{[
(* blanks, i.e. characters to be ignored *)
let blank = Blank.from_charset (Charset.singleton ' ')

let _ =
  try
    while true do
      let f () =
        Printf.printf "=> %!"; (* prompt *)
        Grammar.parse_string (expr Sum) blank (input_line stdin)
      in
      (* [Pos] module provides a function to handle exception with
         an optional argument to call for error (default is to exit with
         code 1 *)
      Pos.handle_exception ~error:(fun _ -> ()) f ()
    done
  with
    End_of_file -> ()

]}

The main function above is [Grammar.parse_string] which takes the grammar to be
parsed, the definition of blanks (sequence of characters to be ignored)
and what to parse (here a [string]).

The BNF above works using the ppx extensions [[%%parser ...]] for structures and
[[%parser ...]] for expression. These are also accessible by suffixing keywords
with [%parser] as in the above example. These ppx extensions extends ocaml
expressions with a syntax for grammars of type ['a Grammar.t] and modifies the
behaviour of let-bindings especially recursive ones to use [declare_grammar],
[set_grammar] and [grammar_family]. Recall that due to the limitation of ppx, we
use a sub-syntax of OCaml expressions for grammars. It is therefore not a good
idea to use "=>" as an infix inside [[%parser ...]]. Moreover, as we are reusing
ocaml syntax, if you fall outside of the BNF below, the expression is unchanged
and compiled by OCaml. This means that a syntax error in the description of the
BNF results in general in a (strange) type error at compilation.

We give below the BNF grammar for the extension, together with a sketch of
its semantics.

]}
[epat] correspond to an encoding of patterns in expressions. Beware that [_] is
invalid, use [__] instead.

Guard using (e =| epat) allows for rule guarded by pattern matching. This
has also been tested with GADT (see examples/calc_ext2.ml).

Action code needs parenthesis or [begin ... end] if it uses [if .. then],
let expressions, pattern matching or sequences.

Anything which does not correspond to this grammar will be unchanged
in the ocaml code (like the type definition in the example
above).  A mutually recursive definition can also mix the definition of
grammars (parametric of not) with the definition of normal ocaml values.
This means you could put the whole file inside [%%parser ...].

Beware that inside the scope of the extension, you can use the syntax for
grammars everywhere. This allows for some nesting as in:
{[
type p = Atom | Prod | Sum
let%parser rec
     expr p = Atom < Prod < Sum
            ; (p=Atom) (x::FLOAT)                             => x
            ; (p=Atom) '(' (x::expr Sum) ')'                  => x
            ; (p=Prod) (x::expr Prod) => ( '*' (y::expr Atom) => x*.y
                                         ; '/' (y::expr Atom) => x/.y)
            ; (p=Sum ) (x::expr Sum ) => ( '+' (y::expr Prod) => x+.y
                                         ; '-' (y::expr Prod) => x-.y)
]}
Remark: the left factorisation in this example is useless: in will be automatically
performed by [Pacomb].

Here is the meaning of let bindings for grammars through the ppx extension:
- non recursive let bindings correspond to just a name for the grammar.
- recursive let bindings correspond either to
  - [Grammar.declare_grammar + Grammar.set_grammar] (if no parameter)
  - [Grammar.grammar_family + setting the grammar] if parameters are given.
    multiple parameters and using label are supported through curryfication
    by the ppx extension.

For recursive grammar with exactly one parameter, a rule [p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_n]
will automatically add rules to include the grammar parameterized by [p_i] in the
grammar parameterized by [p_(i+1)]. This was used by the calculator example above.

[let%parser] accepts the following attribute:
  - [[@cache]] to cache the grammar (that is call [Grammar.cache] on the grammar).
  see {!ambiguous}.
  - [[@merge f]] to apply [f] if two parsetrees are possible for the same input.
    This corresponds to [Grammar.cache ~merge:f].   see {!ambiguous}.
  - [[@layout blank]] or [[@layout blank ~config:expr]] to apply Grammar.layout
    and change the blank characters for that grammar. see {!Pacomb.Blank}.
  - [[@print_param f]] to specify a printing function for the parameters of a
    recursive grammar. The feature is used in [examples/calc_prio.ml] to print
    the grammar when providing the [-help] option.

{1:regexp Regexp syntax}

The regexp syntax is near to the syntax for ocaml's Str module.
There is one notable addition: ["[!...]"] which is similar to ["[^...]"] but
does not parse the characters. For instance, ["x[!y]"] and ["x[^y]"] will both
a 'x' not followed by a 'y', but the first will not consume the character
following the 'x'.

Here is the general syntax of string representing regexp:

- [c] where [c] is any character distinct for the following specials
  ['\\';'.';'*';'+';'?';'[';']'] means accept only the character 'c'

- [\\c] where [c] is one of the  specials
  ['\\';'.';'*';'+';'?';'[';']'] means accept only the character 'c'

- "." means accept any character

- [[...]] is a character range. One can use [a-z] for short.
  The first character car not be [^] nor [!] and [-] must be placed first.
  For instance [[-a-c]] accepts [-abc]

- [[^...]] is the complement of a character range. One can use [a-z] for short.
  The first character car not be [^] nor [!] and [-] must be placed first.
  The character is consumed.

- [[!...]] is the complement of a character range. One can use [a-z] for short.
  The first character car not be [^] nor [!] and [-] must be placed first.
  Same as above, but the character is not consumed.

- [RE?], [RE*], [RE+]: to accept respectively 0 or 1, 0 or more and 1 or more
  repetition of sequences accepted by [RE]

- [RE1RE2]: to accept a sequence accepted by RE1 followed by a sequence accepted by RE2.
is preferred in case of ambiguity.  .

- [RE1\|RE2]: to accept a sequence accepted by RE1 or RE2. The longest match
is preferred in case of ambiguity.  .

- [\(RE\)]: same as RE, for grouping. suffix operators have priority over
  sequence which has priority over alternatives.

{1:right-recursion Controling evaluation of action and right recursion}

Action are evaluated as soon as the rule is reduced. This may be a problem for
grammar whose prefix are ambiguous, even if the grammar is not really ambiguous.
This is notably true for right recursion (which as usual should be avoided). If
nothing is done, right recursion will be quadratic in time, while linear in
space and time is expected (linear space is the reason to prefer left
recursion). To delay evaluation of action, you should use lazy action. For
instance, the right recursive grammar for sexpr below:
{[
let%parser rec sexp =
  (x::RE id)         => Idt x
; '(' (l::sexps) ')' => Lst l
and sexps =
  ()                   => []
; (e::sexp) (l::sexps) => (e::l)
]}
Does not work efficiently because in an expression like "a b c ..."
all the lists [[Idt "a"]], [[Idt "a"; Idt "b"]], etc are constructed.
It should be rewritten using [lazy]:
{[
let%parser rec sexp =
  (x::RE id)              => Idt x
; '(' (lazy l::sexps) ')' => Lst l
and sexps =
  ()                        => lazy []
; (e::sexp) (lazy l::sexps) => lazy (e::l)
]}
or left recursion:
{[
let%parser rec sexp =
  (x::RE id)         => Idt x
; '(' (l::sexps) ')' => Lst (List.rev l)
and sexps =
  ()                   => []
; (l::sexps) (e::sexp) => e::l
]}

Remark: there are some important optimisation for [lazy] so use the [lazy]
keyword as above as much as possible and do not use [Lazy.from_fun] or [Lazy.force]
if you can avoid it.

A similar problem arises if you want to evaluate an action immediately after
a newline has been parsed. As [Pacomb] is trying to read the blank characters
after the newline, the evaluation of the action is restarted.

Remark: right recursion for sequence not using any semantics is optimized and
works in O(1) memory. For instance, the following to parse a list of command
with dependant grammar (hence right recursion is mandatory) works:
{[
let%parser rec cmds env =
    ()                                          => ()
  ; (top_expr env) '\n' (cmds env)              => ()
  ; ((env,()) >: new_rule env) '\n' (cmds env)  => ()
  ; ((env,()) >: rem_rule env) '\n' (cmds env)  => ()
]}
It works for one main reason: we do not use any semantics
for any item in the rule. The first member of the pair for
dependant grammar is used soon enough and does not need a stack.

For instance, if you do not want to use [input_line] as above for your calculator,
you may want to write:
{[
let%parser rec exprs = () => ()
                     ; exprs (x::expr Sum) '\n' => print_float x
]}

This will not work and printing will not occur just after reading the newline.
A solution is to test for newline without reading it to trigger printing:
{[
let nl _ b i _ _ = let (c,_,_) = Input.read b i in c = '\n'
let%parser rec top_expr =
  (t::Grammar.test_after nl expr) => Printf.printf "%g\n=> %!" t
let%parser rec exprs = () => () ; exprs top_expr '\n' => ()
]}

{1:dependent Dependent sequences}

Variable binding in the left part of a rule are not available before the final
action code. Therefore, it can not be used for selecting grammar rule.  For
instance, [(p::prio) (x::g p) => x] will report [p] as unbounded. To solve this,
you can use {e dependent sequences}, using [(x,y)>:item] will allow [x] (but not
[y]) to be used both in the action and the rule. The separation with dependent
(the part that can be used in the rest of the rule) and non dependent part (used
only in the action) is crucial for efficiency. Indeed, dependent grammar are
compiled to combinators at runtime and memorised and you don't want "noise" in
the memorisation. This means you should really use values in a set as small as
possible in dependent parts. Here is an example of grammar using this to
implement an extensible calculator allowing to add extra infix operators with a
given priority (see [tests/calc_ext.ml]):
{[
let%parser rec expr prio =
  ((pe1,e1)>:expr prio) ((pop,b)>:op pe1 prio) ((__,e2)::expr pop)
                             => (pop, b e1 e2)
; (x::FLOAT)                 => (0.0,x)
; '(' (e::expr max_prio) ')' => (0.0,e)
]}
where [op pe1 prio] parse binary operator with priorities between [pe1] and [prio].
The action returns both the expression and its priority level.

It is important to know that dependant or self extensible grammars remain
efficient. The main loss comes from the fact that with dependant grammars,
combinator are composed at tun time are OCaml's inliner can not optimise them.

In principle, you can write a grammar [bnf] to parse your favorite syntax for
BNF and use a rule [(g,__)>:bnf (x::parse_my_bnf g) => x] to parse any BNF! The
function [parse_my_bnf] should call function in the {!Pacomb.Grammar} module to
build the usable grammar and as dependent grammar are memorised, each bnf will be
only compiled once. This really gives the power to write self extensible
language easily.  This is illustrated in the example [tests/calc_ext2.ml] which
accept the following input:
{[
2
(4)
rule "suc" 1 : Str "S" Exp 1 => Cst 1 Op2 "+"
rule "pre" 1 : Str "P" Exp 1 => Cst 1 Op2 "-"
SPPS6
rule "pow" 2 : Exp <2 Str "^" Exp  2 => Op2 "^"
rule "mul" 3 : Exp  3 Str "*" Exp <3 => Op2 "*"
rule "div" 3 : Exp  3 Str "/" Exp <3 => Op2 "/"
rule "add" 4 : Exp  4 Str "+" Exp <4 => Op2 "+"
rule "sub" 4 : Exp  4 Str "-" Exp <4 => Op2 "-"
3*3
2+2
(2+3)*5/2-1
SPS6 * 3 + S1
remove rule "suc"
remove rule "pre"
2^2^2
2^(3^2)
]}

Note: one can fairly well control when action are evaluated and therefore the
parsing may depends upon global references that are modified by your parser
itself. However, purely functional code should be preferred, even for extensible
grammars, because if for instance you have unwanted ambiguities, you will
have a behavior hard to predict and a bug hard to diagnose.

Dependant sequences are also useful to prevent construction of infinite grammar.
For instance in this code from [examples/calc_ext2.ml]:
{[
let%parser rec rule : type a. a ty -> (env -> a Grammar.t) Grammar.t
  = fun t ->
    "Exp" (prio<:FLOAT) (r::rule (Arr(Flt,t))) =>
      (fun env -> (x::expr env (get_prio prio env)) (f::r env) => f x)
  ; "Str" (s<:STRING_LIT) (r::rule t) =>
      (fun env -> (STR s) (x::r env) => x)
  ; "=>" (a::action t) => (fun _ -> () => a)
]}

The construction for the grammar for [rule] would loop in the ["Exp"] rule if we
were not using [<:]. [epat<:item] is equivalent to [((),epat)>:((x::item) =>
((),x))].  This represent a grammar depending from [()], i.e. a constant
grammar.  The only effect if to delay the construction of the grammar right of
[<:] until it is used for the first time.

{1:ambiguous Cache and merge for ambiguous grammars}

Pacomb can manage ambiguous grammars, but this will result in general in very poor
performances and issue a warning: ["Parsing ambiguity, use cache with merge"] on
[stderr]. You can use {!Pacomb.Grammar.parse_all_buffer} to remove the warning,
but you should preferably use cache and merge.

{!Pacomb.Grammar.cache} can be apply to a grammar to produce a cached grammar.
This guaranty that this grammar will at most be called once for each position
in the parsed buffer. This will not solve ambiguity, but may improve performance.
For instance, there are some non ambiguous grammars that Pacomb can not left factorise
(left factorisation is not performed to the left of a dependent sequence).
The annotation [@cache] on [let%parser] will automatically wrap the grammar
with a call to {!Pacomb.Grammar.cache}.

When your grammar is ambiguous, you can give an optional merge function to
{!Pacomb.Grammar.cache}. This function will be called to merge all results
corresponding to exactly the same portion of the input buffer with the cached
grammar.

Here is a toy example (see example/catalan.ml):
{[
let%parser [@merge (+.)] rec bin_seq =
    ()                              => 1.0
  ; (t1::bin_seq) 'a' (t2::bin_seq) => t1 *. t2
]}

This grammar will parse any sequence of ['a'] of length n and return
the number of binary tree with n nodes (i.e. catalan number)! It does
run in polynomial time (O(N^3) in fact, which is not the
best that can be done).

In general, using cache and merge, you should be able to reach O(N^3) time
complexity and O(N^2) space complexity for any BNF grammar. This seems confirmed
by our benchmarks.

{1:positions Getting positions}

In action code (expression right of [=>]), a [lid_lpos] or [lid_rpos] will
denote respectively the left and right position of the item named [lid].  a
[lid_pos] will group both [lid_lpos] and [lid_rpos] in a record of type [Pos.t *
Pos.t]. If the item is matched by a tuple and you want to use its position you
must use [pat = lid] syntax to give a name to the whole item. The variables
[_lpos], [_rpos] and [_pos] corresponds to the position of the input parser by
the whole rule.

Here is an example parsing {e sexpr} with positions:
{[
type sexp = { p: Pos.t * Pos.t; e : sexp' }
and sexp' =
  | Idt of string
  | Lst of sexp list

let id = "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*[']*"

let%parser rec sexp
   =    ; (x::RE id)     => { p = _pos; e = Idt x }
   ; '(' (l::sexps) ')'  => { p = _pos; e = Lst (List.rev l) })
and sexps = () => []
          ; (l::sexps) (e::sexp) => e::l
]}

The type {!Pacomb.Pos.spos} is a very light type to represent position. It contains a
record of type {!Pacomb.Input.type-infos} that is the same for the whole input and the
position in bytes in the input of type {!Pacomb.Input.type-byte_pos}. If you need line
numbers and column number, the {!Pacomb.Pos} module contains the
necessary function to rescan the input and compute it (with a cache to
avoid always rescanning from beginning).

This is important because in general positions are needed only in error
messages and computing line and column number is costly, especially for
utf8.

When parsing a stream that is not a regular file, the whole buffer is
kept to allow rescanning. If your stream is very large, this is not
reasonable. Two solutions: restart parsing at regular interval, or
use the ~rescan:false optional parameters and use only position in bytes.

Another problem with rescanning: if you use [Grammar.parse_channel] or
[Grammar.parse_fd], you can not get line and column number after closing the
channel or file descriptor. However, if you use [Grammar.parse_string] or
[Grammar.parse_file] you can. In this case, It is even possible to marshal (with
closures) the type [Pos.t].  With [Grammar.parse_file] position will remain
correct as long as the file is unchanged.

{1:error Producing nice error messages}

The [ERROR(m)] syntax in the ppx extension allows to add well chosen
error messages in your code. Here is a way to use it on the
[sexp] grammar above:

{[
let%parser rec sexp
   = ERROR(["id";"("])
   ; (x::RE id)         => { p = _pos; e = Idt x }
   ; '(' (l::sexps)     => (ERROR(")") | ')'
                        => { p = _pos; e = Lst (List.rev l) })
and sexps = () => []
          ; (l::sexps) (e::sexp) => e::l
]}

Parsing ["a b (c + ..."] with the above grammar will give
{[
Parse error: Line 1, character 7.
expecting: ) id (
]}

Benchmarks seems to show that adding error cost more or less 15% on the
above example.

{1:limitations Limitations}

Pacomb must eliminate left recursion in grammars in order to use combinators
that would loop otherwise. However, left recursion is not supported if it
traverses A {!Pacomb.Grammar.layout} constructor to change blanks (probably
possible to solve this, but probably not worth it).

Ambiguous grammar will be analysed in polynomial time if and only if you use
a cache for all ambiguous non terminals of your grammar. Pacomb does perform
some left factorisation, but it is not complete. Using cache is also a solution
to that problem. Pacomb has function to print the grammar to see if left
factorisation was performed.

Note: left recursion do not need and is not eliminated if the grammar uses a
cache. However, this solution to use cache in general is too slow for non
ambiguous grammars so we do not impose a cache to all left recursive grammars.

The ppx extension is not too bad but still suffers from the fact that it uses
a sub-language of OCaml to describe grammars. For instance
{[
let%parser g =((_,x)::g) => x]
]}
is not legal because [_] cannot be used in an Ocaml
expression. Though the following works:
{[
let%parser g = ((__,x)::g) => x
]}
The syntax
{[
(((x,y) = z) :: g) => (x,y,z_pos)
]}
is not very nice as we
use [=] to replace the [as] keyword and we also need a lot of parentheses.

A solution would be to rewrite OCaml's parser with pacomb and extend the language
with real grammar extension!
